## Context

It's an attempt for Revision Party 2017 to create a compo for the "wild" category.

I tried to shrink my code to 1K... but i can't get over 1.3 K damn it ! 

## Technical details

It'a a pure fragment shader, build from different source.
The main one is the incredible shadertoy ! [Shader Toy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)

Second, ALL the precious tutorial from inigo
Inigo quilez is my GOD ! [inigo web site](http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/index.htm)
